Formula: 

(p - 1) / (t + 2)^1.5

Description: 

Votes divided by age factor

p = votes (points) from users.
t = time since submission in hours.

p is subtracted by 1 to negate submitters vote.
age factor is (time since submission in hours plus two) to the power of 1.5.

No points "from users upvotting" (my bad) :P

          o Points
          o Score (Possiblilty if we don't want to calculate all the entries every time theres a request)

Actually you need to calculate the score immediately in order not to
loose the time delay. When I clck on the upper arrow on the web link
it gets one point more but the score is recalculated based on the
formula. If I click 3 days later the score will increase a bit, but if
I click immediately after the web link is posted the score will be
higher. Is this a correct reasoning?

No. 
Time delay is the difference in time between the request ti dislay sorted links/comments 
and the submission time.
