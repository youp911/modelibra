Formula: 

(p - 1) / (t + 2)^1.5

Description: 

Votes divided by age factor

p = votes (points) from users.
t = time since submission in hours.

p is subtracted by 1 to negate submitters vote.
age factor is (time since submission in hours plus two) to the power of 1.5.

No points "from users upvotting" (my bad) :P

    * Weblink
          o Name
          o Link
          o Date
          o Points
          o Score (Possiblilty if we don't want to calculate all the entries every time theres a request)
    * Member
          o LastName
          o ...
          o Karma (aka score but with the Hacker News Term)
          
Actually you need to calculate the score immediately in order not to
loose the time delay. When I clck on the upper arrow on the web link
it gets one point more but the score is recalculated based on the
formula. If I click 3 days later the score will increase a bit, but if
I click immediately after the web link is posted the score will be
higher. Is this a correct reasoning?

No. 
Time delay is the difference in time between the request ti dislay sorted links/comments 
and the submission time.

Member properties from HN:

    * Saved: Number of stories (weblinks) that you have upvoted
      onClick transfert to a page that display thoses story
    * showdead: show unpublished stories and comments
    * Noprocrast: If you turn it on by setting it to "yes," you'll only be allowed to visit the site for maxvisit minutes at a time, with gaps of minaway minutes in between. The defaults are 20 and 180, which would let you view the site for 20 minutes at a time, and then not allow you back in for 3 hours. You can override noprocrast if you want, in which case your visit clock starts over at zero.
    * delay: (in minutes) between when you create a comment and when it's visible to others.

showdead: show unpublished stories and comments

Does that mean that comments may be disapproved?
I suppose that a moderator (there are 30 mods at HN) can unpublish a comment.

delay: (in minutes) between when you create a comment and when it's visible to others.

Do you understand the rationale?
Yes, its a counter to flame wars. Many sites have a delay to comment reply, because sometimes a series of reply ressemble more of a chat screen than a comment screen :D
As to why they let the user set this.. this is a mystery.

From the Wicket In Actions book

"Itâ€™s possible (although probablyrare) for a user to go to the login screen, decide to do something else for an hour,
then try to log in using that page of the now-expired session, and be confronted with a
session-expired message. "
